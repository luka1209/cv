  <li><h3>When you hear a negative message, remember that the voice you’re hearing is really only a product of whatever you are most focused on at the moment. For example, if you find yourself reluctant to get out of bed in the morning, you’re probably focused on how comfortable your bed is. Instead, focus on how badly you want to begin your first task. You can tell yourself, “I will get out of bed now because I want to get a strong start to my day!” Focus on the feeling of completion and satisfaction that will come from finishing a task instead of dwelling on how you feel about starting on it. This will change the dialogue you have with yourself and push you to do the things you want</a></li></h3
